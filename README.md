# NumericAkinator-Repository

This repository is part of a group of repositories of fun programs developed for Onda El√©trica with the didactic function of teaching in Public Schools in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. This code presents, in a playful way, the concept of Binary Search applied in a Guess the Number game, where the Machine, through YES or NO questions, guesses the number that the child is thinking of. 

So the aim of this little project is:

- Provide an introduction to the use of Arduino (C++)
- Explore the concept of Binary Search

An image of the project's construction diagram can be seen below. The code and the same image are available in the repository above.
